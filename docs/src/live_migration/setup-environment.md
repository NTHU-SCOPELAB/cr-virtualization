# Setup Environment

## Prerequisites
1. We strongly suggests that your computer have at least 8GB of RAM and 30GB+ of storage space.
2. First, use a hypervisor software to create two virtual machines on your computer.
- If you’re using Linux : QEMU is recommended.
- If you’re using Windows or MacOS : VMWare Workstation or VMWare Fusion are recommended.

The download link for VMware's software can be elusive, so you might need to put in some effort to locate it.

3. Next, go to download Ubuntu-24.04 desktop version as your Guest OS. It’s about 5.9G. 
You can grab it from here: [download link](https://free.nchc.org.tw/ubuntu-cd/24.04/)  
  
4. Search for [detailed](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/how-to-run-ubuntu-desktop-on-a-virtual-machine-using-virtualbox#1-overview) [installation guide](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop#5-installation-setup) if you don't know how to install Ubuntu yet.
